title: "Applying What I Learned in School at NowDream"
description: "With relatively fresh memory from school, I tried hard to apply what I learned as a Statistics major. Such things as penalized regression, ANOVA table, and two sample t-test come to mind. I also had a chance to play with a small distributed system that had Hadoop and Hive installed. It probably unlocked my interest towards computer systems and software engineering."
