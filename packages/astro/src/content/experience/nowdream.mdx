This was my first job as a data analyst, fresh out of college. With coursework still fresh in my mind‚Äîthough no longer the case now‚ÄîI remember earnestly trying to apply everything I'd learned in school: penalized regression, ANOVA tables, two-sample t-tests, you name it.

But what left a deeper mark on me during this period wasn't the statistics.

This was the first time I encountered **remote development**. Back in school, my "IDE" was just a local desktop app‚Äî[RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/). But now, I was accessing RStudio through a browser, connecting to a remote machine running [RStudio Server](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio-server/). At the time, this setup‚Äîan IDE in the browser, running off a desktop tower in the corner of the office‚Äîfelt like dark magic üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

To interact with that server, I had to use an SSH client like [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/) to connect to it, which opened up a Bash shell running Linux. That was my first real exposure to a Unix-like system. I was so fascinated by the terminal that I'd log in just to mess around with **shell commands** and utilities. It was completely new to me, and it was fun.

It was also the height of the big data hype cycle, and I got to dip my toes into tools like [Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/) and [Apache Hive](https://hive.apache.org/). In fact, **HiveQL** was the first query language I ever learned‚Äîwell before I touched SQL proper.

Looking back, that experience‚Äîmore than any specific data analysis task‚Äîis probably what first nudged me toward the world of computer systems and software engineering.
