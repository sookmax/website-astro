**Statistics**—a field built on measuring uncertainty—was hard. I mean, I have immense respect for statisticians and mathematicians who managed to wrestle uncertainty into elegant mathematical frameworks like [probability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory). But for someone who originally intended to major in Economics, the leap into statistical theory felt abstract, unintuitive, and frequently overwhelming.

Still, there was something about it that pulled me in. The concepts were difficult, but also deeply fascinating. Most of the time, I was confused. But on rare occasions, things _clicked_—and in those moments, I felt a kind of quiet euphoria that made all the struggling worth it.

I don't quite know how I managed to make it through, but I did—and I'm grateful for it. If nothing else, those years built the foundation I'd later rely on to tackle tough technical problems: mental resilience and sheer doggedness.
