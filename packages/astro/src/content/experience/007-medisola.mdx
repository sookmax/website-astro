I've been working at [Medisola](https://www.medisola.co.kr/) for a couple of months now, and I'm actively building and maintaining an internal software tool called "Recipe Design" (in the form of a web app). This tool is mainly used by the company's products team to design and manage recipes for the meals (products) that Medisola provides.

It's also been a great experience for me as a frontend developer, because I got to build a web app from scratch, using the tech stack that I wanted to use, some of which I had never used in production before&mdash;most notably, [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router/latest), [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest), [TanStack Table](https://tanstack.com/table/latest), and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)&mdash;and they all turned out to be great choices for building a single page application (SPA). It was also the first time I got to work with a [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) backend (database & auth), and I loved how easy it was to query the database and manage user authentication with their JavaScript client, [supabase-js](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/introduction). I should also mention that this time, I finally decided to write and maintain end-to-end tests diligently for the web app using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), and they have been a great confidence booster every time I needed to fix bugs, add new features, or refactor the codebase, knowing that things that used to work wouldn't break unexpectedly (or at least less likely).
