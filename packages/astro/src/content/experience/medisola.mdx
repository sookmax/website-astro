## Joining MEDI.SOLA

<ImageGallery images={["medisola-1.png", "medisola-2.png"]} />

Health, nutrition, and diet have long been personal interests of mine, and MEDI.SOLA operates in that very space&mdash;offering high-quality, nutrient-dense packaged meals for people with medical conditions and others who care deeply about what they eat. I was excited to see how I, as a web developer (and a bit of a fitness enthusiast), could help the company build better tools and grow.

## Building Recipe Design

A couple of months in, I began designing and building an internal tool called Recipe Design&mdash;a web app used by the product team to create, test, and manage the recipes behind MEDI.SOLA's meals. I started the project from scratch using a tech stack I trusted, some of which I was eager to try in production for the first time&mdash;most notably, [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router/latest), [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest), [TanStack Table](https://tanstack.com/table/latest), and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/).

The result was a highly interactive, snappy React single-page application (SPA) that significantly boosted the productivity of the internal team.

It was also my first time working with [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) (for database, authentication, and storage), and I was impressed with how smooth the experience was using their JavaScript client, [supabase-js](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/introduction).

One of my personal highlights was committing to end-to-end testing from the start using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/). It gave me strong confidence in shipping changes&mdash;fixing bugs, adding features, or refactoring code&mdash;without worrying about breaking existing functionality.
