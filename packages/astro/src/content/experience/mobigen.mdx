It was my second job as a data analyst, but the first time I worked at a company that actually shipped software products.

Mobigen already had a few B2B SaaS offerings generating revenue when I joined, and their engineering department was sizable. I was part of a brand-new data analytics team they were forming. I didn't get to work directly on the product codebases, but I sat near the engineering team, and it was hard not to be curious about how the whole system came together.

**Python** was their go-to language, and you could tell the engineering culture was strong—our CTO even ran a weekly Python study group for newcomers, which I joined. My background was in R, but being surrounded by Python-fluent engineers and data analysts, I naturally gravitated toward the Python data ecosystem: [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).

Around this time—2016 and 2017—interest in machine learning was exploding. Online lectures by people like [Andrew Ng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ng), [Yann LeCun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yann_LeCun), and [Christopher Bishop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Bishop) made these topics feel newly accessible. Everyone seemed to be talking about deep learning, [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), and the future of AI.

I was caught up in the excitement too, but what stuck with me more than the algorithms themselves was _how software was built_ to serve real users. Although there weren't many interactions, watching engineers at work gave me my first glimpse into **software engineering**—and planted a seed that would grow into something more.
