This was my third and final job as a data analyst‚Äîand the stepping stone that led me to become a web developer.

Roughly half of my time here was spent on projects attempting to predict stock price movements. Unsurprisingly, we failed pretty hard‚Äîour models hovered around 50% accuracy, a glorified coin toss üëç. In hindsight, we leaned too much on modeling without truly understanding the data or domain‚Äîand honestly, even the modeling itself wasn't that deep. We, including the lead analyst, treated a sophisticated algorithm like [XGBoost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XGBoost) as just another function call, blindly tweaking hyperparameters and hoping for the best.

It baffled me how some professionals could hold advanced degrees yet treat complex models like black boxes without making an effort to understand what's going on under the hood. This project felt like a failure from the very start.

When the data doesn't contain any meaningful signals, no amount of modeling or data processing will improve the outcome‚Äîin other words, garbage in, garbage out. And what we often mistook for a ‚Äúsignal‚Äù turned out to be noise or even errors in the data processing pipeline.

That's ultimately why I started losing interest in data analytics. I was frustrated by how much the quality of a data analyst's work _depended_ entirely on the quality of the data‚Äîand high-quality data was rare in the projects I was on.

On the other hand, I found myself far more engaged in the peripheral IT work that was nonetheless essential for data analysts to get things done: Linux shell scripting, cron jobs, process management, SSH tunneling‚Äînot to mention distributed big data technologies like **Hadoop** and **Spark**.

So I was lucky when I got involved in a project that required migrating client data from Oracle to our analytics cluster, which ran on [HDFS](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.2.1/hdfs_design.html). I used [Sqoop](https://sqoop.apache.org/) to move entire databases into [Hive tables](https://docs.cloudera.com/HDPDocuments/HDP2/HDP-2.4.2/bk_dataintegration/content/using_sqoop_to_move_data_into_hive.html), and manually rewrote complex Oracle SQL into HiveQL.

This kind of hands-on experience‚Äîand my growing curiosity for engineering‚Äîpaved the way for a role change that would shape the rest of my career.

After repeatedly showing my interest and aptitude for engineering work, I was finally allowed to transfer to the development team. Our product was a _B2B analytics platform_ targeted at fellow data analysts‚Äîso I brought in the unique advantage of having once been the user myself.

I was optimistic. Maybe even overconfident. I thought my background in R, Python, and Linux would help me ramp up quickly. What I didn't anticipate was the sheer scale of the stack I was thrown into:

- A backend in Java (with [Vert.x](https://vertx.io/docs/)),
- A frontend in [React](https://react.dev/),
- [MariaDB](https://mariadb.com/docs/) as our database,
- Deployed on [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)‚Äîdespite the fact that a single-node setup probably would've sufficed.

I spent months working 3-4 extra hours every night just to catch up. Reading docs, debugging unfamiliar codebases, failing and learning repeatedly. But slowly, things began to click.

Eventually, I was building major features independently. But as I got more familiar with the system, I also started questioning architectural decisions:

- Why Kubernetes, when a simpler setup could've worked?
- Why not [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) for container orchestration?
- Why choose Vert.x over more conventional frameworks?
- Why use [GlusterFS](https://www.gluster.org/) when we didn't need distributed storage?

These questions felt important because they directly impacted our productivity as we tried to build a real product‚Äîand we were constantly bogged down by the friction these technologies introduced.

I didn't always find clear answers, and the more aware I became of the issues, the more frustrated I felt&mdash;in hindsight, this growing frustration probably planted the seed for me to look for a better engineering opportunity.

My frustration actually peaked with the state of the frontend codebase. The React app was bootstrapped with [this now-defunct boilerplate](https://github.com/erikras/react-redux-universal-hot-example), meant for isomorphic rendering. But we were only doing **client-side rendering**‚Äîmeaning we didn't need all the overhead of Node.js and SSR and a simple static hosting would have sufficed, yet we still had a complex server and bloated architecture. I gave an internal presentation just to express my concern.

## Finally, a Greenfield Frontend Project

I was fortunate enough later on to be asked to build the UI for a brand new product _from scratch_. I was thrilled. Finally, I could:

- Use modern React with **hooks** (no more class components)
- Pick sensible libraries (while keeping the dependencies minimal) such as:
  - [Blueprint.js](https://blueprintjs.com/docs/)
  - [TanStack Table](https://tanstack.com/table/latest)
  - [ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html)
  - [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)
- Avoid unnecessary complexity.

But as excited as I was about hooks, I quickly ran into issues with `useEffect()`. Some effects grew so convoluted that I had to sprinkle in `console.log()` just to understand their runtime behaviors. I admit I overused them due to my limited understanding of the React rendering model, and in the end, some of my own `useEffect()`s were so fragile I was afraid to touch them.

That pain stuck with me‚Äîand it was the beginning of my journey toward writing better, more maintainable frontend code. In many ways, it also marked the true start of my identity as a **frontend developer**.
