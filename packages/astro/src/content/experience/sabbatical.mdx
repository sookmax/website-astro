## Project: My Website (1st Iteration)

<DateAndLocation class="ml-4 -mt-4 mb-4" from="2022-10" to="2022-11" />

I originally planned to maintain the site with discipline&mdash;writing regularly about web development and software engineering. But that turned out to be a lot harder than I expected. After a few posts, I abandoned the writing routine (and the website itself) and moved on to other things. Still, it was a good exercise in setting up a project from scratch and getting my thoughts out in public, even briefly.

Along the way, I also spent time researching the [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) and [unified](https://unifiedjs.com/) plugin ecosystem&mdash;exploring how to enhance the rendering of content blocks like syntax-highlighted code snippets, custom components, and more. That experience gave me a much clearer understanding of how MDX content is parsed, transformed, and rendered on the web.

## Project: Website Redesign for My Cousin

One of my cousins wanted to redesign the website for the university lab he was running (originally built with Wix), so I built him a brand-new site with a cleaner design, using **Next.js 13** and **Tailwind CSS**.

This wasn't a commercial or paid project&mdash;it came from goodwill, and from my own curiosity to tinker with the new **App Router** and **React Server Components (RSC)** introduced in [Next.js 13](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13).

Looking back, I didn't fully understand it at the time, but I _did_ notice that navigation between pages felt noticeably slower than I'd expected. Later, I realized that this was due to the way RSC works: on every navigation, the browser hits the server again to fetch a fresh RSC payload&mdash;similar to traditional SSR or SSG sites.

In contrast, earlier versions of Next.js used **client-side navigation** by default. While that approach requires a heavier initial JS payload, once everything is loaded, transitions between pages feel nearly instantaneous.

This experience helped me understand a nuanced aspect of web performance: **RSC can improve initial page load times**, but it doesn't necessarily make subsequent navigations faster. It was a valuable lesson in how architectural choices affect perceived performance on the web.

## Project: Adding a CMS to My Cousin's Site

<DateAndLocation class="ml-4 -mt-4 mb-4" from="2023-01" to="2023-02" />

After launching the redesigned site, an obvious limitation emerged: my cousin had to manually edit the source code and push changes to GitHub just to publish new content. It was inconvenient&mdash;and clearly not sustainable in the long run.

While researching ways to solve this, I came across the term [headless CMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_content_management_system): a content management system that's decoupled from the presentation layer and serves content via API endpoints.

That was exactly what I needed. After looking around, I settled on Sanity&mdash;a headless CMS with strong developer reviews, solid documentation, and a helpful [Next.js integration template](https://vercel.com/templates/blog/blog-nextjs-sanity) to get started.

Once I began customizing the template and digging into the docs, I realized just how big a leap it was to go from editing markdown files to using a fully-fledged CMS. I had to:

- Define structured content using [Sanity Schemas](https://www.sanity.io/docs/apis-and-sdks/introduction-to-schemas)

- Customize the rich text editor with my own formatting shortcuts

- Learn [GROQ](https://www.sanity.io/docs/sanity-studio-quickstart/querying-content-with-groq) — Sanity's query language

- Set up preview/publish flows using [Next.js API Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) and [Sanity Webhooks](https://www.sanity.io/docs/compute-and-ai/webhooks#k0886e01e4e1f)

I eventually got everything working the way I wanted, but the complexity of it all left me both impressed by what CMSes make possible&mdash;and curious if there might be simpler alternatives out there.

Still, I think headless CMSes are incredibly empowering tools for non-technical content creators. I'm looking forward to trying out other options like [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) in the future.
