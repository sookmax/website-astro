## Project: My Website (1st Iteration)

<DateAndLocation class="ml-4 -mt-4 mb-4" from="2022-10" to="2022-11" />

<ImageLink
  link="https://website-old-sook.vercel.app/"

/>

I originally planned to maintain the site with discipline&mdash;writing regularly about web development and software engineering. But that turned out to be a lot harder than I expected. After a few posts, I abandoned the writing routine (and the website itself) and moved on to other things. Still, it was a good exercise in setting up a project from scratch and getting my thoughts out in public, even briefly.

Along the way, I also spent time researching the [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) and [unified](https://unifiedjs.com/) plugin ecosystem&mdash;exploring how to enhance the rendering of content blocks like syntax-highlighted code snippets, custom components, and more. That experience gave me a much clearer understanding of how MDX content is parsed, transformed, and rendered on the web.
