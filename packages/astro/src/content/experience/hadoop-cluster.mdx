Back in 2016-2017, I was completely fascinated by the world of **distributed computing**—especially with tools like [Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/) and [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/). The idea that a cluster of machines could work together to process massive datasets—scaling computation across nodes like a little data center—was just too cool to ignore.

Sure, I could've set everything up using virtual machines on a laptop. But instead, I went the "fun" (read: expensive and unnecessary) route and built a physical Hadoop cluster using four **mini PCs**—one for each node. Looking back, it was absolutely overkill, but it made the project all the more enjoyable.

I configured everything manually:

- Chose [CentOS](https://www.centos.org/) as the Linux distro
- Tuned CPU fan speeds (those tiny machines could get loud!)
- Assigned Hadoop and Spark daemons across nodes
- Set up [RStudio Server](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio-server/) on one node so I could interact with **HDFS** and submit **Spark jobs through R**

Although I didn't get much practical use out of the cluster at the time, it laid a solid foundation in distributed systems, and I learned a ton about networking, cluster orchestration, and data infrastructure.

In fact, I ended up repurposing the same hardware later on as a **Kubernetes dev cluster**, which turned out to be incredibly handy during my early engineering career.

Sometimes you build something just for fun—and it ends up paying off in ways you never expect.
