title: "Graduated College with a Statistics Degree"
description: "Statistics and Math as subjects were both terrifying and fascinating. Very painful when things didn't really click (which was most of the time), but in rare occasions, I got these moments of enlightenment that were very rewarding. Didn't taste enough of those moments, however, for me to dare to pursue a career in academia."
